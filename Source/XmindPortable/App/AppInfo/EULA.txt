sale of access to the Site or its related services (such as the Xmind Widget) on another website;
use of the Site or its related services (such as the Xmind Widget), for the primary purpose of gaining advertising or subscription revenue;
the sale of advertising, on the Site or any third-party Site, targeted to the content of specific Submissions or Xmind content;

Prohibited commercial uses do not include:
uploading an original Submission to Xmind, to promote your business or artistic enterprise;
using the Xmind Widget to show Xmind files on an ad-enabled blog or website, provided the primary purpose of using the Xmind Widget is not to gain advertising revenue or compete with Xmind;
any use that Xmind expressly authorizes in writing.
You agree not to use or launch any automated system, including without limitation, “robots,” “spiders,” or “offline readers,” that accesses the Site in a manner that sends more request messages to the Xmind servers in a given period of time than a human can reasonably produce in the same period by using a conventional on-line web browser. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Xmind grants the operators of public search engines permission to use spiders to copy materials from the site for the sole purpose of and solely to the extent necessary for creating publicly available searchable indices of the materials, but not caches or archives of such materials. Xmind reserves the right to revoke these exceptions either generally or in specific cases.

In your use of the Site, you will otherwise comply with the terms and conditions of these Terms of Service and all applicable local, national, and international laws and regulations.
Xmind reserves the right to discontinue any aspect of the Site at any time or to terminate a user's access for violating these Terms of Service.
XMIND CLOUD
You may sign in to activate Xmind Cloud with your Xmind account. Please abide by the following terms of service when using Xmind Cloud:

Xmind Cloud only permits the synchronization of Xmind files. You agree not to disguise files of other formats to Xmind files and synchronize to Xmind Cloud.
Our service of Xmind Cloud enables you to upload, submit, save and download Xmind files. You reserve all the intellectual property rights on your contents. Xmind shall not copy, share or transmit your files to any third party, unless you give permission personally.
When you upload, submit and save your contents to our server, or download contents through our service, you give a global permission to Xmind which allows Xmind to host and save your files. In the meantime, Xmind provides some service allowing you to visit and delete the contents you offered to Xmind. Due to the restrictions of some countries and enterprises, please make sure that you have necessary permissions on any content you submit to our server.
Please make sure that the contents you upload, submit, or save to our server are completely legitimate, including but not limited to the texts, photos, attachments of the mind maps, etc.. If not, Xmind has the unilateral privilege to delete the illegal files, or to cancel the rights of visiting and editing, or to take other actions.
If you activate the service of Xmind Cloud, your name and personal photo might be displayed in this service.
Many people sharing one Xmind account is forbidden, so please reconfirm that you shall not reveal or share your account to others, or it might lead to file losses or changes.
SUBMISSIONS
If you are a Submitter, you understand that whether or not your Submissions are displayed or otherwise made available, Xmind does not guarantee any confidentiality or security with respect to any such Submissions.
You shall be solely responsible for your Submissions and the consequences of posting or publishing them. In connection with Submissions, you affirm, represent, and/or warrant that:

Nothing in these Terms of Service change, affect or diminish in any way whatever rights Submitters may have in the Submissions. By submitting the Submissions to Xmind, however, you hereby grant Xmind a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, sublicensable and transferable license to use, reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works of, display, and perform the Submissions in connection with the Site and Xmind's (and its successor's) business, including without limitation for promoting and redistributing part or all of the Site (and derivative works thereof) in any media formats and through any media channels (except to the extent limited by, and expressly stated in the applicable additional terms and conditions for, services offered by Xmind). You also hereby grant each user of the Site (subject to such limitations, if any, that may apply with respect to premium services) a non-exclusive license to access your Submissions through the Site, and to use, reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works of, display and perform such Submissions as permitted through the functionality of the Site and under these Terms of Service. Certain Submissions may be provided with, and subject to, other licenses, such as the Creative Commons license, which may affect how you use those Submissions.

You hereby represent and warrant that you will not:
upload to or make available via the Site any Submission containing material that is copyrighted, protected by trade secret or otherwise subject to third party proprietary rights, including privacy and publicity rights, unless you are the owner of such rights or have permission from their rightful owner to post the material and to grant Xmind all of the license rights granted herein;
publish falsehoods or misrepresentations that could damage Xmind or any third party;
submit material that is unlawful, obscene, defamatory, libelous, threatening, pornographic, harassing, hateful, racially or ethnically offensive, or encourages conduct that would be considered a criminal offense, give rise to civil liability, violate any law, or is otherwise inappropriate;
post advertisements, promotional materials, “junk mail,” “spam,” “chain letters,” “pyramid schemes” or any other form of solicitation;
upload, post, email, transmit or otherwise make available any material that contains software viruses or any other computer code, files or programs designed to interrupt, destroy or limit the functionality of any computer software or hardware or telecommunications equipment;

Xmind does not permit copyright infringing activities and infringement of intellectual property rights on its Site, and Xmind will remove all Submissions if we have a reasonable belief that such Submission infringes on another's intellectual property rights. Xmind reserves the right to remove Submissions without prior notice. Xmind will also terminate a user's access to its Site, if they are determined to be a repeat infringer. A repeat infringer is a user who has been notified of infringing activity more than twice and/or has had a Submission removed from the Site more than twice. Xmind also reserves the right to decide whether any Submission is appropriate and complies with these Terms of Service for violations other than copyright infringement and violations of intellectual property law, such as, but not limited to, pornography, obscene or defamatory material, or excessive length. Xmind may remove such Submissions and/or terminate a user's access for uploading such material in violation of these Terms of Service at any time, without prior notice and at its sole discretion.
