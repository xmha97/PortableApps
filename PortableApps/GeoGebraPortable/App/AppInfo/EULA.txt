GeoGebra License FAQ

What exactly is the GeoGebra software?

When we refer to "GeoGebra" software or as a product, we are reallyreferring to a number of component parts which together form the workingGeoGebra software program. The most important of these constituent partsare:

  * the Java source code, which forms the heart of the software program,allowing for GeoGebra's interactive functionality;

  * the installers (which bundle the source code, our language and otherdocumentation files for use on various operating systems) and webservices (such as GeoGebra Materials platform). The installers allowyou to install the software on your computer or use it through yourinternet browser; and

  * the language files, which allow you to enjoy the functionality ofour software in many different languages. The language files are anindependent add-on to our software and GeoGebra can work without them.

These distinctions are important when considering how GeoGebra islicensed <https://www.geogebra.org/license>, as these constituent partsare made available under different licenses.

How is GeoGebra licensed?

We license the different component parts of GeoGebra differentlydepending on their origin (authorship) and depending on your intendeduse of GeoGebra (see also next question):

  * the source code is licensed under the EUPL 1.2.

  * the GeoGebra installers (for various platforms including Linux, MacOS, Windows, Android, iOS) and our web services (including theGeoGebra Materials platform) are made available under our ownlicensing terms <https://www.geogebra.org/license>. We allow you touse the installers and web services for non-commercial purposesonly, provided you acknowledge GeoGebra; and

  * the GeoGebra language files are made available under a CreativeCommons license, which allows non-commercial use of these files.

If you use a component part of GeoGebra in isolation or as part of aderivative work, you need to comply with the relevant license applicableto that part as stated above. However, any use of the overall GeoGebraproduct is subject to the other license terms above and therefore mayonly be used for non-commercial purposes, unless you have entered into alicense with us for commercial use.

Thus, there are really many different licenses involved in the background.

Who can use GeoGebra free of charge?

GeoGebra and our web services are made available free of charge for non-commercial users <https://www.geogebra.org/license>. Most of our usersare students and teachers and they usually fall under our non-commerciallicense, allowing them to use and distribute GeoGebra and relatedmaterials free of charge at home and in school.

Commercial users pay a moderate license fee, which helps us tocontinually improve GeoGebra and keep it free for non-commercial users.Please see some examples <https://www.geogebra.org/license> on how wedistinguish non-commercial and commercial use. If you are not surewhether your use is commercial or not, please just get in touch with usat office@geogebra.org <mailto:office@geogebra.org>.

Is GeoGebra free and open source software?

The GeoGebra source code is open source software. You can find oursource code online <https://github.com/geogebra/geogebra>, and we areactively collaborating with the open source community. Thanks a lot toall contributors for their great work!

Please note that GeoGebra as a complete software program would probablynot be considered "free" software in line with the understanding of thatterm in the open source community. This is because the restrictions oncommercial use that apply to the GeoGebra installers, web services andlanguage file add-ons create a restriction on the software as a whole(thus making it "non-free"), even though the GeoGebra source code ismade available under the EUPL v1.2 without restriction.

Most importantly, GeoGebra will always continue to be available free ofcharge for students and teachers for all major operating systems.GeoGebra GmbH is dedicated to the open source movement and collaborationwith members of the open source community — please get in touch with usat office@geogebra.org <mailto:office@geogebra.org> if you'd like tohelp us make GeoGebra even better.
