1. The Internet Download Manager (IDM) computer software, artwork and other components included in this version of product (collectively the "Software") are the exclusive copyrighted property of Tonec Inc. You must not (a) sell, rent, lease or sublicense all or any portion of the Software; (b) modify or prepare derivative works of the Software; (c) reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble the Software; (d) publish serial numbers or serial number generation algorithms.

2. You are granted one user license to use the trial version of Software for any legal non-commercial purposes during 30 days trial period on one computer. After the expiration of the trial period, you must either uninstall Software, or purchase a full Software license.

3. If you have purchased a lifetime full Software license, you are granted one user license to use the Software on one computer. You should use Software for any legal purpose. The usage of Software with lifetime license has no time limitation, but the period of free updates is limited to 3 years after the first use of product key (serial number).

4. If you have purchased one-year full Software license, you are granted one user license to use the Software on one computer during one year after the first use of product key (serial number). You should use Software for any legal purpose. The usage of Software with one-year license has one year time limitation. It means that Software stops working in one year and asks for another license, unless the license is extended for another year by paying one-year license fee again. The period of free updates is limited only by the expiration time of one-year license. Thus, while Software works with one-year license, you can always update Software freely.

5. the Software uses an official "IDM integration module" add-on/extension to integrate with browsers. It's not allowed to use the Software with 3rd party extensions/add-ons that have similar but different names because these fake extensions don't provide the required level of integration and can be a security threat on your computer. The authors are not responsible for the usage of such 3rd party add-ons/extensions with the Software.

6. The Software may be distributed freely if the distribution package is not modified and if you give a link to Software home page. You must not bundle the Software in any other distribution packages and take distribution fees without our agreement.

7. Google Chrome pushes a new type of extensions called Manifest 3 extensions. Old Manifest 2 extensions will be gradually disabled in Chrome in 2024. Please note that the functionality of Manifest 3 extensions is worse than the current Manifest 2 extensions. Google has limited many old V2 functions in Manifest V3. There is a way to prolong usage of Manifest 2 extensions for several months by adding "ExtensionManifestV2Availability" Chrome Enterprise policy. IDM adds "ExtensionManifestV2Availability" Chrome Enterprise browser policy if you use IDM’s Manifest 2 extension. As the result Chrome may show that the browser is managed. You may turn it off any time in IDM Options -> General tab. You may read more about it on our web site.
