Privacy information

This Privacy Policy applies to two entities: the ImageGlass software and this website. Please note that this policy may be updated without prior notice.

Last update: July 27th, 2024

Software

There are two versions of ImageGlass: the "Microsoft Store" version and the "Classic" version. The Microsoft Store version is available on the Microsoft Store, while the Classic version can be downloaded from this website.

Data Collection and Transmission

ImageGlass software does not collect or transmit any personal information. The only data transmission occurs during update checks, which involve downloading a small file from the website. This process is anonymous and can be disabled in the Settings dialog.

Additionally, when you open a link from the software to this website, ImageGlass appends an anonymous query string to the URL. This helps us display website content tailored to your software version.

  * Classic version: The Classic version of ImageGlass does not collect any information beyond what is mentioned above.

  * Microsoft Store version: The Microsoft Store version of ImageGlass does not collect any information directly. However, Microsoft may collect certain information anonymously as part of their store services.
